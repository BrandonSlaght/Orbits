# Orbits

This project originated as a final project for my senior year app development course. Occasionally sees active development. 

Features planet and moon information, images, models, and rise/set times. More features are on the eventual roadmap. Code contributions are welcome. [Available on the App Store.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/orbits-a-planet-tracker/id1220543514, "App Store link")
